# Introduction

Progressively is a self-hosted feature flag solution focusing on lightweight client side impact, accessibility and with no tracking.

## Whats is a feature flag service?

It's a service that allows to show or hide functionalities on the fly for a specific set of users. There are multiple (more mature) alternatives such as [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/), [Split](https://www.split.io/), [Unleash](https://www.getunleash.io/) and [many others](https://devcycle.com/blog/best-feature-flags-of-2022)...

See the following example where the left side is a dashboard managing feature flags and the right side is a client application showing content based on the toggle value:

<ExampleFeatureFlag />



## What is Progressively composed of?

- **The dashboard**, where you manage your feature flags
- **The backend (+ APIs)**, where the computations are made
- **SDKs** to connect your project to the backend
