# Introduction

Progressively is a self-hosted feature flag solution focusing on lightweight client side impact, accessibility and with no tracking.

## Whats is a feature flag service?

It's a service that allows to show or hide functionalities on the fly for a specific set of users. There are multiple existing solutions on the market such as [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/), [Split](https://www.split.io/), [Unleash](https://www.getunleash.io/) and [many others](https://devcycle.com/blog/best-feature-flags-of-2022)...

See the following example where the left side is a dashboard managing feature flags and the right side is a client application showing content based on the toggle value:

<ExampleFeatureFlag />

## Whats are Progressively's features?

- Projects / environments / flags / strategies management
- Rollout strategies (on/off, percentage based, by fields etc...)
- Websocket based ("real time" updates)
- SSR friendly

_Keep in mind that the project is pretty new and that new features will come with time._

## What is Progressively composed of?

- **The dashboard**, where you manage your feature flags
- **The backend (+ APIs)**, where the computations are made
- **SDKs** to connect your project to the backend
