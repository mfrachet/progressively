# Welcome to the Progressively documentation

Progressively is an [Open Source feature flags solution](https://github.com/mfrachet/progressively) built on top of [Remix](https://remix.run/), [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/).

On this website, you will find information on how to start the service and how to configure your applications to use it.

Enjoy and don't forget to help improving the tool by [filling, intelligently, issues and request features](https://github.com/mfrachet/progressively/issues) :blush:.
